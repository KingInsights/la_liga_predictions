## Introduction

Predicting football match outcomes is a complex task due to the dynamic and multifaceted nature of the game. This project serves as a comprehensive walkthrough, detailing the entire process of forecasting La Liga match results using machine learning. From data acquisition and cleaning to model training and prediction, each step is thoroughly covered to provide a clear understanding of the methodologies and techniques employed in creating predictions based on historical data.

## Setup

### Choose Your Environment

You can run this project either locally using Jupyter Lab or online using Google Colab. Follow the appropriate setup instructions below:

### Running the Notebook Locally with Jupyter Lab

1. **Install Jupyter Lab**:
   - Open your command line (Terminal on macOS/Linux or Command Prompt on Windows).
   - Install Jupyter Lab using pip:
     ```
     pip install jupyterlab
     ```

2. **Download the Project**:
   - Download the project files from the repository. You can download it as a ZIP file from GitHub and extract it to your desired directory.
   - Alternatively, you can clone the repository using Git:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/la-liga-prediction.git
     cd la-liga-prediction
     ```

3. **Start Jupyter Lab**:
   - Navigate to the project directory in your command line:
     ```
     cd path/to/your/project/directory
     ```
   - Start Jupyter Lab:
     ```
     jupyter lab
     ```

4. **Open Jupyter Lab**:
   - Your default web browser will open Jupyter Lab, typically at `http://localhost:8888/lab`.

5. **Upload Files (if necessary)**:
   - In the Jupyter Lab interface, you can upload files by clicking the "Upload" button in the file browser pane on the left. Select the files you need from your local machine.

6. **Open the Notebook**:
   - In the Jupyter Lab interface, navigate to the project directory.
   - Open the `spanish_la_liga_gh.ipynb` notebook file.

### Running the Notebook Online with Google Colab

1. **Open Google Colab**:
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Upload the Notebook**:
   - Click on `File` > `Upload notebook` and select the `spanish_la_liga_gh.ipynb` file you downloaded.

## Running the Project

Once you have chosen your environment (Jupyter Lab or Google Colab) and set it up, follow these steps to run the project:

### Run the Notebook Cells

Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform the following tasks:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install all necessary Python libraries and packages required for the project.

2. **Scrape the La-Liga Fixtures and Results**:
   - Collect the 2023-2024 season La-Liga match data from online sources using web scraping techniques.

3. **Save the Data**:
   - Store results into a CSV file for further analysis and to avoid unnecessary web scraping.

4. **Clean and Preprocess the Data**:
   - Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove any inconsistencies.
   - Preprocess the data to ensure it is in the right format for machine learning.

5. **Prepare Data for Machine Learning**:
   - Transform the cleaned data into features and labels suitable for training machine learning models.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.

6. **Add Predictors**:
   - Introduce additional features (predictors) to enhance the model's predictive power.

7. **Train the RandomForestClassifier**:
   - Train a RandomForestClassifier model using the training dataset.

8. **Use the Trained Model to Make Predictions**:
   - Apply the trained model to the test dataset to predict match outcomes.
   - Generate predictions for the match results.

9. **Evaluate the Model with a Classification Report**:
   - Assess the modelâ€™s performance using a classification report.
   - Evaluate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

10. **Calculate and Add Additional Predictors**:
    - Re-engineer the dataset to include new predictors based on further analysis and domain knowledge.

11. **Use the Trained Model to Make Further Predictions**:
    - Apply the trained model to the dataset with additional predictors.
    - Generate updated predictions based on the refined model.

12. **Evaluate the Model Again with a Classification Report**:
    - Re-evaluate the model's performance with the new predictors using a classification report.
    - Compare the updated evaluation metrics to the previous results to determine improvements in model accuracy and robustness.

13. **Thoughts on Further Investigations and Improvements**:
    - Reflect on potential areas for further investigation and improvement to enhance model performance and predictive accuracy.
